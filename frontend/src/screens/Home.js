    <p>
      Retail traders (individual traders who don&#39;t work for a financial
      institution like a bank or hedge fund) generally suck at trading. In the
      Foreign Exchange markets, some people use the percentage of retail traders
      who are long or short a given currency pair as a contrarian indicator
      (meaning that if most people are short, the pair is likely to rise and
      vice versa).
    </p>

    <p>
      For the stock market, it&#39;s a bit different. One of the most useful
      things that you can do with the data that this site provides is to figure
      out how people are reacting to moves in the market. Depending on if people
      are buying the dip, getting onboard during a pump because they think
      it&#39;s going to go higher, or taking profits, this data lets you observe
      each of those different situations and plan your own trading accordingly.

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
      Every hour, the price and popularity for every stock on Robinhood is
      downloaded from the Robinhood API and stored. By combining all of these
      data points together, it&#39;s possible to view trends and analyze the
      ways in which they both change with respect to each other and over time.
